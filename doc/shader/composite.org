* Composite passes
  The composite passes are full-screen passes for processing results produced in
  previous passes. We use texture names to identify textures to read from and
  write to. The following line will read from the lighting texture in deferred
  pass and transparency pass.
  #+begin_src glsl
  layout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform sampler2D inLighting;
  #+end_src
  And the following line will write to this texture bound at location 0.
  #+begin_src glsl
  layout(location=0) out vec4 outLighting;
  #+end_src

  Multiple composite passes can be created with name =composite1.frag=,
  =composite2.frag=, etc. The texture named =Lighting= be the final lighting
  texture. The Composite pass is responsible for creating effects such as motion
  blur, bloom, and SSR.
