* Shadow pass (optional)
  Multiple shadow passes for multiple light sources is possible. Conceptually,
  shadow pass runs in parallel with the gbuffer pass and uses similar resources.
  Currently, only a vertex shader is allowed for the shadow. For directional
  shadow, the shaders should be named =directional_shadow_XXX.gbuffer= where
  =XXX= is a number starting from 0. For spot shadow, the should be named
  =spot_shadow_XXX.gbuffer= where =XXX= is a number starting from 0. The shadow
  maps will later be attached as samplers =samplerDirectionalShadowXXX= and
  =samplerSpotShadowXXX=.
