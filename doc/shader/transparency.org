* Transparency pass
  Transparency pass is essentially a single forward shading pass, combining
  gbuffer and deferred pass. It is designed to use all resources in the
  gbuffer and deferred pass.

  The following buffers are used
#+begin_src glsl
layout(binding = 0, set = 0) uniform SceneBuffer { ... } sceneBuffer;
layout(binding = 0, set = 1) uniform CameraBuffer { ... } cameraBuffer;
layout(binding = 0, set = 2) uniform ObjectBuffer { ... } objectBuffer;
layout(binding = 0, set = 3) uniform MaterialBuffer { ... } materialBuffer;
#+end_src
  They should be exactly the same as ones used in the gbuffer and deferred passes.

  The input textures should follow the ones used in gbuffer pass. The output
  texture follow the same rules as before.
